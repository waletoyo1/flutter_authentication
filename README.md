# Flutter App Authentication Using Firebase and flutter_login Package
* Authenticating an app is one of the most important steps in building an app.
* It can be a daunting task especially when you want to quickly build a prototype of your idea
* This tutorial simplifies it for you by giving you a template you can quickly modify and build your app.


# Procedures to install this template:
* Run git clone url_of_this_repository
* Run flutter pub get (to install all the packages associated with this template)
* Change your app Id from "com.example.flutter_authentication" to your desired name
* If you are using Vs code, you can easily change your app id by pressing Ctrl + H
* After changing the app Id, rename this path (kotlin/com/example/flutter_authentication) to correspond to your new app Id.
* Connect your app to firebase. Visit http://firebase.google.com for guidance.
* Enable Email/password in your firebase console under Authentication


* Run your app 
* NB: I added a UserManerger class to collect inside firestore immediately a user signs up.
